# Sample UI for displaying spots and apply filter

Open [index.html] file in a web browser. You will see the UI containing spots formatted and arranged according to the requirement.

It contains a search box on top. Entering text into the text box shows suggestions based on your search history. For results to load, press enter after the text is entered. The search results are based on the text entered in the search box and filtered on the given fields (by date, client, channel, city, campaign, brand name).

Clicking on a thumbnail in a spot opens the video in a modal.

A Hide/Show option is given for each group of spots for a particular date.

A reload button is given which reloads the page contents after clearing the search text in the search box.
